# white-paper
R markdown template for white papers: relatively informal documents but with references and features (stamping knitted documents with git commit and date) supporting reproducible work. Clone the repo and add your written content (including figures, tables, etc.), then knit to either pdf (LaTeX), html, or an html format inspired by readTheDocs (but other predefined formats are available) just by selecting the desired format. Uses R markdown's default pandoc template but allows customization by specifying yaml parameters or adding HTML or LaTeX; template offers some helpful examples.
